## About Me

I attended [Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts) to study witchcraft, supervised by **Dumbledore** and other professors. 

I'm trying my best to battle with Lord Voldemort, the evil Wizard that we all fear. My research area includes Defence Against the Dark Arts and other magic. :dizzy:

  **Implicit Euler ODE Networks for Single-Image Dehazing Based on Implicit Structure**

  Jiawei Shen, *et al*
  
 Inspiring from the Euler method, we considered Residual Network (Res-Net) an explicit scheme network, which associates with implicit scheme, 
 then we introduce a network based on implicit scheme to process low-level tasks.

  **A Lightweight Network to Learn Optical Flow from Event Data**
  
  Zhuoyan Li, Jiawei Shen, *et al*
  
  Intergrating Laplacian pyramidal processing into Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we proposed an lightweight network to process the optical flow 
  information from event data in event camera.
