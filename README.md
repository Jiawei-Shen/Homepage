## Projects

<ProjectCard image="/projects/1.png" hideBorder=true>

  **Implicit Euler ODE Networks for Single-Image Dehazing Based on Implicit Structure**

  Jiawei Shen, *et al*

 Inspiring from the Euler method, we considered Residual Network (Res-Net) an explicit scheme network, which associates with implicit scheme,
 then we introduce a network based on implicit scheme to process low-level tasks.

  **A Lightweight Network to Learn Optical Flow from Event Data**

  Zhuoyan Li, Jiawei Shen, *et al*

  Intergrating Laplacian pyramidal processing into Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we proposed an lightweight network to process the optical flow
  information from event data in event camera.
