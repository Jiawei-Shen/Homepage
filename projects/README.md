## Projects

<ProjectCard image="/projects/1.png" hideBorder=true>

  **Implicit Euler ODE Networks for Single-Image Dehazing Based on Implicit Structure**

  Jiawei Shen, *et al*
  
 Inspiring from the Euler method, we considered Residual Network (Res-Net) an explicit scheme network, which associates with implicit scheme, 
 then we introduce a network based on implicit scheme to process low-level tasks.

  **Technical Research of Super-Resolution Image Reconstruction based on a lightweight network**
  Wenlan Wei, Juan Du, Jiawei Shen, Ziyu Zhou, *et al*
  
  Using Network Pruning, Weight Sharing, and Quantitative interception to reduce the weight of the network.

  **A Lightweight Network to Learn Optical Flow from Event Data**
  Zhuoyan Li, Jiawei Shen, *et al*
  
  Intergrating Laplacian pyramidal processing into Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we proposed an lightweight network to process the optical flow 
  information from event data in event camera.

## Course Projects

<ProjectCard>

  **Color Filling based on GAN Network**
  
  We trained a simple GAN network to fullfill the color of monochrome image. Also, at the end of that semester, 
  we build a website to display that Color Filling model.
